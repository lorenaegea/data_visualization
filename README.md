Module 5 Challenge

Assist Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, in screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In their most recent animal study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Prepare the data and generate summary statistics, as well as tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study, and a summary of the study results.
